Once upon a time I thought it might be fun to build an NES Emulator for the Windows Phone.  I started this project in .NET of course and started by reverse engineering the Instruction Set and building a virtual model of the CPU.  Next I would have moved on to the IO but surely got distracted by another shiny thing and never finished it before the Windows Phone was canned.  Nevertheless I get tired of l33t c0d3 br0s comin' at me in 5u73r eL33t Interviews so IDK come at me bros :-D
